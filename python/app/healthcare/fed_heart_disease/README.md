## Data Download instructions

Set download in the config file to True. Note that please only set download to True at the first time you run the code.

```yaml
data_args:
  dataset: "Fed-Heart-Disease"
  data_cache_dir: ~/healthcare/heart_disease # flamby
  partition_method: "hetero"
  partition_alpha: 0.5
  debug: false # flamby: debug or not
  preprocessed: false # flamby: preprocessed or not, need to preprocess in first
  download: true # flamby: download or not
```

**IMPORTANT :** If you choose to relocate the dataset after downloading it, it is
imperative that you run the following script otherwise all subsequent scripts will not find it:

```
python update_config.py --new-path /new/path/towards/dataset
```

## Training

1. Environment setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML

cd FedML/python/app/healthcare/fed_heart_disease
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd config/
bash bootstrap.sh

cd ..
pip install flamby[heart_disease]
```

2. Run the MPI simulation

```bash
bash run_simulation.sh [CLIENT_NUM]
```

There are only 4 center in this case, so the maximum number of clients is 4.

3. Run the edge server and client using MQTT or on MLOps

If you want to run the edge server and client using MQTT, you need to run the following commands.

```bash
bash run_server.sh your_run_id

# in a new terminal window
bash run_client.sh [CLIENT_ID] your_run_id
```

Client ID is the id of the client from 1 to 4.
