class EWMPolicy(AutoscalingPolicy):
    """
    Configuration parameters for the reactive autoscaling policy.
    EWM stands for Exponential Weighted Calculations, since we use
    the pandas.DataFrame.ewm() functionality.

    For panda's EWM using alpha = 0.1, we indicate that the most recent
    values are weighted more. The reason is that the exponential weighted
    mean formula in pandas is computed as:
        Yt = X_t + (1-a) * X_{t-1} + (1-a)^2 X_{t-2} / (1 + (1-a) + (1-a)^2)

    The following parameters refer to:
    - ewm_mins: the length of the interval we consider for reactive decision
    - ewm_alpha: the decay factor for the exponential weighted interval
    - ewm_latest: the latest recorded value of the metric's exponential weighted mean
    - ub_threshold: the upper bound scaling factor threshold for reactive decision
    - lb_threshold: the lower bound scaling factor threshold for reactive decision

    Example:

        Let's say that we consider 15 minutes as the length of our interval and a
        decay factor alpha with a value of 0.5:
            Original Sequence: [0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 3, 5, 10]
            EWM Sequence: [0.1, [0.166, 0.3, 1.74, 3.422, 6.763]

        If we assume that our previous scaling operation was triggered at value Y,
        then the conditions we use to decide whether to scale up or down are:
            Latency:
                ScaleUP: X > ((1 + ub_threshold) * Y)
                ScaleDown: X < (lb_threshold * Y)
            QPS:
                ScaleUP: X < (lb_threshold * Y)
                ScaleDown: X < ((1 + ub_threshold) * Y)

        In other words, QPS is the inverse of Latency and vice versa.
