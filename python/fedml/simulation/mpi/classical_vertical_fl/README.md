## Algorithm Description
This algorithm is implemented based on the following publication:


Private federated learning on vertically partitioned data via entity resolution and additively homomorphic encryption \
Stephen Hardy, Wilko Henecka, Hamish Ivey-Law, Richard Nock, Giorgio Patrini, Guillaume Smith, Brian Thorne \
https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10677

This implementation is a distributed computing version. It is developed based on the idea of ensemble learning.
Therefore, some similar learning paradigms can also reuse this framework (e.g., multi-modality).
