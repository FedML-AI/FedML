Its original idea is presented at the live [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93SETZGZMyI) and [white paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13518) by FedML co-founder Dr. [Chaoyang He](https://chaoyanghe.com). ![FedML Code Architecture](./doc/en/_static/image/fedml.png)After March 2022, FedML has been upgraded as an AI company which aims to provide machine learning capability anywhere at any scale. Now the python version of FedML [https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML-/tree/master/python](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/python) is reorganized as follows:**core**: The FedML low-level API package. This package implements distributed computing by communication backend like MPI, NCCL, MQTT, gRPC, PyTorch RPC, and also supports topology management. Other low-level APIs related to security and privacy are also supported. All algorithms and Scenarios are built based on the "core" package.**data**: FedML will provide some default datasets for users to get started. Customization templates are also provided.**model**: FedML model zoo.**device**: FedML computing resource management.**simulation**: FedML parrot can support (1) simulating FL using a single process (2) MPI-based FL Simulator (3) NCCL-based FL Simulator (fastest)**cross_silo**: Cross-silo Federated Learning for cross-organization/account training**cross_device**: Cross-device Federated Learning for Smartphones and IoTs**distributed**: Distributed Training: Accelerate Model Training with Lightweight Cheetah**serve**: Model serving, tailored for edge inference**mlops**: APIs related to machine learning operation platform (open.fedml.ai)**centralized**: Some centralized trainer code examples for benchmarking purposes.**utils**: Common utilities shared by other modules.## Simplified APIs<img src="doc/en/_static/image/apioverview.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:60%;"/> <br />Our philosophy of API design is to reduce the number of APIs to as few as possible while simultaneously keeping the flexibility.For Simplicity, FedML Parrot has only one line API as the following example with `fedml_config.yaml` (an example is here: [https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/blob/master/python/examples/simulation/sp_fedavg_mnist_lr_example/fedml_config.yaml](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/blob/master/python/examples/simulation/sp_fedavg_mnist_lr_example/fedml_config.yaml))```Python# main.pyimport fedmlif __name__ == "__main__":    fedml.run_simulation()``````python main.py```You will get the following output:```[FedML-Server(0) @device-id-0] [Sun, 01 May 2022 14:59:28] [INFO] [__init__.py:30:init] args = {'yaml_config_file': '', 'run_id': '0', 'rank': 0, 'yaml_paths': ['/Users/chaoyanghe/opt/anaconda3/envs/mnn37/lib/python3.7/site-packages/fedml-0.7.8-py3.7.egg/fedml/config/simulation_sp/fedml_config.yaml'], 'training_type': 'simulation', 'using_mlops': False, 'random_seed': 0, 'dataset': 'mnist', 'data_cache_dir': './data/mnist', 'partition_method': 'hetero', 'partition_alpha': 0.5, 'model': 'lr', 'federated_optimizer': 'FedAvg', 'client_id_list': '[]', 'client_num_in_total': 1000, 'client_num_per_round': 10, 'comm_round': 200, 'epochs': 1, 'batch_size': 10, 'client_optimizer': 'sgd', 'learning_rate': 0.03, 'weight_decay': 0.001, 'frequency_of_the_test': 5, 'using_gpu': False, 'gpu_id': 0, 'backend': 'single_process', 'log_file_dir': './log', 'enable_wandb': False}[FedML-Server(0) @device-id-0] [Sun, 01 May 2022 14:59:28] [INFO] [device.py:14:get_device] device = cpu[FedML-Server(0) @device-id-0] [Sun, 01 May 2022 14:59:28] [INFO] [data_loader.py:22:download_mnist] ./data/mnist/MNIST.zip[FedML-Server(0) @device-id-0] [Sun, 01 May 2022 14:59:31] [INFO] [data_loader.py:57:load_synthetic_data] load_data. dataset_name = mnist...```You can also customize the hyper-parameters with `fedml_config.yaml`. Check [this tutorial for one-line example](https://doc.fedml.ai/simulation/examples/sp_fedavg_mnist_lr_example.html) for details.For flexibility, one-line API can also be expanded into five lines of APIs. To illustrate this, now let's switch to FedML Octopus (cross-silo federated learning) as example (Source code: [https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/python/examples/cross_silo/mqtt_s3_fedavg_mnist_lr_example](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/python/examples/cross_silo/mqtt_s3_fedavg_mnist_lr_example)).In this example, the FL Client APIs are as follows:```Pythonimport fedmlfrom fedml.cross_silo import Clientif __name__ == "__main__":    args = fedml.init()    # init device    device = fedml.device.get_device(args)    # load data    dataset, output_dim = fedml.data.load(args)    # load model    model = fedml.model.create(args, output_dim)    # start training    client = Client(args, device, dataset, model)    client.run()```With these APIs, you only need to tune the hyper-parameters with the configuration file `fedml_config.yaml`. An example is as follows:```yamlcommon_args:  training_type: "cross_silo"  random_seed: 0data_args:  dataset: "mnist"  data_cache_dir: "./../../../data"  partition_method: "hetero"  partition_alpha: 0.5model_args:  model: "lr"  model_file_cache_folder: "./model_file_cache" # will be filled by the server automatically  global_model_file_path: "./model_file_cache/global_model.pt"train_args:  federated_optimizer: "FedAvg"  client_id_list: "[1, 2]"  client_num_in_total: 1000  client_num_per_round: 2  comm_round: 50  epochs: 1  batch_size: 10  client_optimizer: sgd  learning_rate: 0.03  weight_decay: 0.001validation_args:  frequency_of_the_test: 5device_args:  worker_num: 2  using_gpu: false  gpu_mapping_file: config/gpu_mapping.yaml  gpu_mapping_key: mapping_defaultcomm_args:  backend: "MQTT_S3"  mqtt_config_path: config/mqtt_config.yaml  s3_config_path: config/s3_config.yamltracking_args:  log_file_dir: ./log  enable_wandb: false```Now let's run some examples as follows to get a sense of how FedML simplifies federated learning in diverse real-world settings. ## **FedML Parrot Examples**Simulation with a Single Process (Standalone):- [sp_fedavg_mnist_lr_example](./doc/en/simulation/examples/sp_fedavg_mnist_lr_example.md):   Simulating FL using a single process in your personal laptop or server. This is helpful when researchers hope to try a quick algorithmic idea in small synthetic datasets (MNIST, shakespeare, etc.) and small models (ResNet-18, Logistic Regression, etc.). Simulation with Message Passing Interface (MPI):- [mpi_torch_fedavg_mnist_lr_example](./doc/en/simulation/examples/mpi_torch_fedavg_mnist_lr_example.md):   MPI-based Federated Learning for cross-GPU/CPU servers.  Simulation with NCCL-based MPI (the fastest training):- In case your cross-GPU bandwidth is high (e.g., InfiniBand, NVLink, EFA, etc.), we suggest using this NCCL-based MPI FL simulator to accelerate your development. ## **FedML Octopu Examples**Horizontal Federated Learning:- [mqtt_s3_fedavg_mnist_lr_example](./doc/en/cross-silo/examples/mqtt_s3_fedavg_mnist_lr_example.md): an example to illustrate how to run horizontal federated learning in data silos (hospitals, banks, etc.)Hierarchical Federated Learning:- [hierarchical_fedavg_mnist_lr_example](./doc/en/cross-silo/examples/hierarchical_fedavg_mnist_lr_example.md): an example to illustrate how to run hierarchical federated learning in data silos (hospitals, banks, etc.). Here `hierarchical` means that inside each FL Client (data silo), there are multiple GPUs that can run local distributed training with PyTorch DDP, and then the FL server aggregates globally from the results received from all FL Clients.## **FedML Beehive Examples**- [Federated Learning on Android Smartphones](./doc/en/cross-device/examples/mqtt_s3_fedavg_mnist_lr_example.md)# **MLOps User Guide**[https://open.fedml.ai](https://open.fedml.ai)Currently, the project developed based on FedML Octopus (cross-silo) and Beehive (cross-device) can be smoothly deployed into the real-world system using FedML MLOps.FedML MLOps Platform simplifies the workflow of federated learning anywhere at any scale.It enables zero-code, lightweight, cross-platform, and provably secure federated learning.It enables machine learning from decentralized data at various users/silos/edge nodes, without the need to centralize any data to the cloud, hence providing maximum privacy and efficiency.![image](./doc/en/_static/image/MLOps_workflow.png)The above figure shows the workflow. Such a workflow is handled by web UI without the need to handle complex deployment.
