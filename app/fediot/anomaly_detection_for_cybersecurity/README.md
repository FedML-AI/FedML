## Training Script

At the client side, the client ID (a.k.a rank) starts from 1.
Please also modify config/fedml_config.yaml, changing the `client_num_in_total`, `client_num_per_round`, `worker_num` 
as the number of clients you plan to run.

For this application, the number of clients is up to 9 since there are 9 types of devices in N-BaIoT dataset.

At the server side, run the following script:
```
bash run_server.sh
```

For client 1, run the following script:
```
bash run_client.sh 1
```
For client 2, run the following script:
```
bash run_client.sh 2
```
Note: please run the server first.
