## Prerequisite
Install command line tool `unar`: 

for MacOS
```
brew install unar
```
for Linux
```
sudo apt-get install unar
```

## Real-deployment Training Script

At the client side, the client ID (a.k.a rank) starts from 1.
Please also modify config/fedml_config.yaml, changing the `client_num_in_total`, `client_num_per_round`, `worker_num` 
as the number of clients you plan to run.

For this application, the number of clients is up to 9 since there are 9 types of IoT devices in N-BaIoT dataset.

At the server side, run the following script:
```
bash run_server.sh
```

For client 1, run the following script:
```
bash run_client.sh 1
```
For client 2, run the following script:
```
bash run_client.sh 2
```
Note: please run the server first.

## Centralized Simulation Training Script

We also support centralized simulation for FedIoT, which means one PC could simulate both server and clients as you need.
All training related parameters are inside config_simulation/fedml_config.yaml, please modify it per your need.
The worker_num under the device_args represents number of processes in MPI, as the number of parallel clients.

For this application, the number of clients is up to 9 since there are 9 types of IoT devices in N-BaIoT dataset.
Run the following script to begin the training:
```
sh run_simulation.sh 9
```
9 in the above script represents the number of parallel clients, which should be identical to the worker_num inside config_simulation/fedml_config.yaml.

## A Better User-experience with FedML MLOps (open.fedml.ai)
To reduce the difficulty and complexity of these CLI commands. We recommend you to use our MLOps (open.fedml.ai).
FedML MLOps provides:
- Install Client Agent and Login
- Inviting Collaborators and group management
- Project Management
- Experiment Tracking (visualizing training results)
- monitoring device status
- visualizing system performance (including profiling flow chart)
- distributed logging
- model serving
