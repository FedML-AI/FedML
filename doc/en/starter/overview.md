* FedML Open Source Library ([https://github.com/FedML-AI](https://github.com/FedML-AI))
* FedML Edge SDK and MLOps Platform ([https://open.fedml.ai](https://open.fedml.ai))

The software architecture of the open-source library is on the left side.
MLOps platform further reuses the source code of the open-source library (the green-colored box).


## 2. User-friendly MLOps platform to simplify collaboration and real-world deployment
