# Open Source Code Architecture
In general, FedML source code architecture follows the paper which won the [Best Paper Award at NeurIPS 2020 (FL workshop)](https://chaoyanghe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NeurIPS-SpicyFL-2020-Baidu-best-paper-award-He-v2.pdf). Its original idea is presented at the live [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93SETZGZMyI) and 
[white paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13518) by FedML co-founder Dr. [Chaoyang He](https://chaoyanghe.com).

### Code Architecture
As of March 2022, FedML has been made into an AI company which aims to provide machine learning capability anywhere at any scale. The python version of FedML [https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML-refactor/tree/master/python](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML-refactor/tree/master/python) is now reorganized as follows:

**core**: The FedML low-level API package. This package implements distributed computing by communication backend like MPI, NCCL, MQTT, gRPC, PyTorch RPC, and also supports topology management. 
Other low-level APIs related to security and privacy are also supported. All algorithms and Scenarios are built based on the "core" package.

**data**: FedML will provide some default datasets for users to get started. Customization templates are also provided.

**model**: FedML model zoo.

**device**: FedML computing resource management.

**simulation**: FedML parrot can supportï¼š (1) simulate FL using a single process (2) MPI-based FL Simulator (3) NCCL-based FL Simulator (fastest)

**cross-silo**: Cross-silo Federated Learning for cross-organization/account training

**cross-device**: Cross-device Federated Learning for Smartphones and IoTs

**distributed**: Distributed Training: Accelerate Model Training with Lightweight Cheetah

**serve**: Model serving, tailored for edge inference

**mlops**: APIs related to machine learning operation platform (open.fedml.ai)

**centralized**: Some centralized trainer code examples for benchmarking purposes.

**utils**: Common utilities shared by other modules.
