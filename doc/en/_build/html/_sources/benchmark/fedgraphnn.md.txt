## Federated Graph Neural Networks (FedGraphNN)

For FedGraphNN, we require the latest version of PyG.

### Graph-Level Federated Graph Neural Networks 

- [Federated Molecular Property Prediction with Moleculenet Datasets](./fedgraphnn/moleculenet.md): An example to illustrate how to simulate cross-silo horizontal federated learning in data silos for molecular property predictino via GNNs.

- [Federated Social Network Classification](./fedgraphnn/social_graphs.md): An example to illustrate how to cross-silo federated network classification in data silos for molecular property predictino via GIN.

### Subgraph-Level Federated Graph Neural Networks 

- [Federated Recommender System Subgraph Link Prediction](./fedgraphnn/recsys.md):  An example to perform link prediction over dispersed subgraphs via GNNs.

### Node-Level Federated Graph Neural Networks 

- [Federated Ego-Network Node Classification](./fedgraphnn/egonet_nodeclf.md): An example to classify nodes in a social networks in federated settings via ego-network representations.

- [Federated Ego-Network Link Prediction](./fedgraphnn/egonet_linkpred.md): An example to determine link/connection types in a social networks in federated settings via ego-network representations.
