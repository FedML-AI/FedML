# Social Network Classification with Federated TUDataset

## Motivation 

There has been an skyrocketing interest in
supervised ML with graph data, especially
using graph neural networks in recent years. TUDataset is the most popular dataset used for
for graph classification and
regression. Our aim is to provide a federated platform to simulate federated graph classification and regression tasks. Thus, we introduce federated TUDataset benchmark for FedML users. All you need to do is to install FedML and PyG!

## Training

Here, we provide scripts and  config files under `config/` to explore different model and dataset combinations!

```
sh run_social_networks.sh 4
