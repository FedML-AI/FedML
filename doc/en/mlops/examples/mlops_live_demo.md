# FedML MLOps Live Tutorial

FedML MLOps Platform simplifies the workflow of federated learning anywhere at any scale.
It enables zero-code, lightweight, cross-platform, and provably secure federated learning.
It enables machine learning from decentralized data at various users/silos/edge nodes, without the need to centralize any data to the cloud, hence providing maximum privacy and efficiency.

Researchers/engineers from anywhere on the earth can build a group to train models collaboratively. Please check out the video above to see how easy and funny four persons in different cities in the world (Dallas, USA; Tokyo, Japan; Los Angeles, USA) do machine learning socially, privately, and collaboratively.
